The notified body in question shall, upon receipt of information about vigilance cases from a manufacturer or competent authorities, decide which of the following options to apply:
—
not to take action on the basis that the vigilance case is clearly not related to the certification granted,
—
observe the manufacturer's and competent authority's activities and the results of the manufacturer's investigation so as to determine whether the certification granted is at risk or whether adequate corrective action has been taken,
—
perform extraordinary surveillance measures, such as document reviews, short-notice or unannounced audits and product testing, where it is likely that the certification granted is at risk,
—
increase the frequency of surveillance audits,
