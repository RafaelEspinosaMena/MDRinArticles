Those procedures shall ensure that advertising or promotional activities in no way imply or are capable of leading to an inference that their conformity assessment will offer manufacturers earlier market access or be quicker, easier or less stringent than that of other notified bodies;
(d)
have documented procedures requiring the review of pre-application information, including the preliminary verification that the product is covered by this Regulation and its classification, prior to issuing any quotation to the manufacturer relating to a specific conformity assessment; and
(e)
